# Anvil server
A from-scratch implementation of a HttpServer.

It will be a very basic implementation of Server and Client for other modules in this repository. Aside from basic handling of HTTP protocol with JSON body, it will be implemented on need-to-have basis. It will NOT be a complete implementation.

I started the implementation following post by Joshua Davies on [his blog](https://commandlinefanatic.com/cgi-bin/showarticle.cgi?article=art076).
